In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.\\n\", 'After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus\\n', 'Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.\\n', '\\n', 'Repository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector\\n', '\\n', 'A small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset\\n', '\\n', 'Thank you for your time!\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 80979 84068: Wow @919969394098 !!!\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:38 pm - +91 77109 79055: Crazy skills @919969394098\\n', \"30/04/2020, 5:40 pm - +91 88284 70904: Wow it's amazing👌🏻👌🏻\\n\", '30/04/2020, 5:42 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍🔥\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 82916 21138: 👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Well done amazing work❤️❤️\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:48 pm - +91 97681 67131: Wow 🤩👍👍\\n', '30/04/2020, 5:49 pm - +91 99693 94098: Thanks everyone! ❤️\\n', '30/04/2020, 6:17 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): 🙌🏻🔥\\n', '30/04/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Woah!\\n', '30/04/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Good work 👍\\n', '30/04/2020, 6:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: 💯💯🙌🏻\\n', '30/04/2020, 6:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is wow!!\\n', 'Great work\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:04 pm - +91 98331 51331: Too good @919969394098\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:14 pm - Tushar Nankani: Amazing work 🙌🏻🙌🏻 @919969394098\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Thank you!! 🙌🏻🙏🏻\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Sirrr 🔥@919969394098\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:41 pm - +91 99693 94098: 😂😂😂\\n', '30/04/2020, 7:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): is it better to implement a Deque using ArrayList or LinkedList?I just wanted to know as im new to DS\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: LinkedList I suppose\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Easier insertions and deletions of elements\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Also sorting\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk ty\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Why are you implementing Deque\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): to solve some qs?\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): no just learning it from some article\\n', '30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): i mean in java,you can create a deque object either with ArrayList or LinkedList\\n', '30/04/2020, 9:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, sorting is horrible in LinkedList.\\n', '30/04/2020, 9:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah\\n', '30/04/2020, 9:17 pm - +91 98331 51331: Oh my bad\\n', '30/04/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 73043 57388: But if u practice sorting using linkedlist ur pointer concepts in c/c++ will be sharped and u will become fast with pointers.\\n', '30/04/2020, 11:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I meant performance wise.\\n', '01/05/2020, 11:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://www.instagram.com/p/B_omRqOgBCf/?igshid=112w8iyoawgrw\\n', '01/05/2020, 11:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Have a look at this☝️🤯\\n', '01/05/2020, 12:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://hownot2code.com/2016/09/02/a-space-error-370-million-for-an-integer-overflow/\\n', '01/05/2020, 12:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): 🤯\\n', '01/05/2020, 1:37 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): God damn.\\n', '01/05/2020, 2:13 pm - +91 96648 44643: *UGC* Official Update *29 April 2020*:\\n', '\\n', '➡Due to COVID -19, All Universities and colleges remain closed till *30th June*\\n', '\\n', '➡End semester exams for final years can be conducted from *1st July* till *31st July*\\n', '\\n', '➡Admissions for the year 2020 starts on *1st August* till *31st August*\\n', '\\n', '➡Project Reviews, Viva , Dissertation,etc. can be conducted through online from *15th May*\\n', '\\n', '➡College sessions will begin in August for current students and September for new ones\\n', '\\n', '➡For the academic year 2020-2021 classes will be held 6 days a week (i.e.Monday - Saturday)\\n', '\\n', '➡For 1st years and 2nd years there will be no Exams conducted.
